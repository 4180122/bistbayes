# InsuLearn
InsuLearn is an intuitive and robust distributed system designed to perform regression and classification on medical data, while preserving data security and privacy.  InsuLearn is built on ensemble learning, in which statistical models are developed at each institution independently and combined at secure coordinator nodes. InsuLearn protocols are designed such that the liveness of the system is guaranteed as institutions join and leave the network. Coordination is implemented as a cluster of replicated state machines, making it tolerant to individual node failures.  Fault-tolerant replication is achieved using the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm.

* bclass/       : A simple classification library and Bayesian aggregation scheme implemented in Go
* client/       : Examples of different client implementations using the bclass or distmlMatlab libraries with and without replication, some of which are instrumented with GoVector
* distmlMatlab  : Library for interfacing with built-in MATLAB classification, regression, and ensemble techniques
* server/       : Examples of different client implementations using the bclass or distmlMatlab libraries with and without replication, some of which are instrumented with GoVector
* testdata/     : Example training and testing data for an execution with 5 nodes.

## Compatibility

The Go only implementations which use the bclass library is cross-platform compatible and has been tested on 64 bit Windows, Linux, and OS X. The MATLAB based implementations (distmlMatlab library) interface with MATLAB using the [MATLAB Engine API for C](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/calling-matlab-engine-from-c-c-and-fortran-programs.html), and require [nonshared, single session, engine instances](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/apiref/engopensingleuse.html) that are only supported on 64 bit Windows platforms up to MATLAB version R2016b. The distmlMatlab implementations have been tested on 64 bit Windows 7, 8.1, Server 2012 and MATLAB versions R2011b, R2014b, R2015a, and R2016b.

## Installation

To use InsuLearn you must have a correctly configured go development environment, see [How to write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)

Once you set up your environment, InsuLearn can be installed into the designated GOPATH directory.

#### bclass Dependencies (Cross-Platform 64 bit)
The bclass polynomial classification library require the [gonum matrix library](https://github.com/gonum/matrix), which can also be installed with the go tool command:

```
go get github.com/gonum/matrix/mat64
```
#### distmlMatlab Dependencies (64 bit Windows Only)
The following steps are required to enable communication between Go and MATLAB via cgo and MATLAB Engine API.

 1. Install 64 bit MATLAB (R2011b or newer) into default directory
 2. Set MATLAB run-time library path (see [instructions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/building-and-running-engine-applications-on-windows-operating-systems.html))
 3. Install 64-bit gcc compiler for windows ([TDM-GCC-64 5.1.0](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download))
 4. Create the following symbolic links because the cgo linker does not play well with windows paths (must be done with Administrative privilages):

	```
	mklink /D <InsuLearn_root_directory>\include <matlab_install_directory>\extern\incldue
	
	mklink /D <InsuLearn_root_directory>\distmlMatlab\include <matlab_install_directory>\extern\incldue
	
	mklink /D <InsuLearn_root_directory>\lib <matlab_install_directory>\bin\win64
	
	mklink /D <InsuLearn_root_directory>\distmlMatlab\lib <matlab_install_directory>\bin\win64 
	```
 5. Ensure that the distmlMatlab\matlabfunctions\ folder has write privilages
 6. Update MATLAB_FUNCTION_PATH in distmlMatlab\matlabfun.c to the distmlMatlab\matlabfunctions folder
 6. Update batch files with apropriate paths for MATLAB run-time and gcc compiler

#### Other Dependencies
The following libraries are required for Raft replication and GoVector instrumentation:
```
go get github.com/arcaneiceman/GoVector/govec
go get github.com/coreos/etcd/raft
```


## Client-Side Commands

The implementation of the client prompts the user for the following commands.

* read  : Reads data from disk.
* push  : Pushes trained model to server.
* pull  : Request global model from server.
* train : Train local model from local data (reports error).
* valid : Validate global model with local data.
* test  : Test local model with test data.
* testg : Test global model with test data.
* who   : Print node name.
